For the final project, I wanted to create something that was simple but functional. I wanted to make something that could help me with everyday tasks like studying. I decided that a Pomodoro timer would be a fun challenge since it fit my needs in being simple and functional. The Pomodoro technique is the idea of taking tasks that you need to and breaking it into small blocks of work rather than doing it all at once.  A typical Pomodoro timer you would have online would have you work for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break after, and then the process would repeat 4 times until you have a longer 15 minute break. The idea is that breaking up your work into chunks with small breaks can help you be more productive and it makes bigger tasks less daunting. 

The key fucntions of this project is that the timer is able to respond to user-input on when to start tasks and breaks or when to exit and finish a task. The timer should also be able to to countdown from 25 minutes for a working task, countdown from 5 minutes for a short break, then repeating that process 4 times before giving a longer 15 minute break, then resetting to the beginning.
