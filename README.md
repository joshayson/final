The key functions of this project is that the timer is able to respond to user-input on when to start tasks and breaks or when to exit and finish a task. The timer should also be able to countdown from 25 minutes for a working task, countdown from 5 minutes for a short break, then repeating that process 4 times before giving a longer 15-minute break, then resetting to the beginning.
